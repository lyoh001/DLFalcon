# Fine-tuning Large Language Model (LLM) on a Custom Dataset with QLoRA

This repository provides a guide on how to fine-tune the [Falcon 7b Large Language Model (LLM)](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)  on a custom dataset using QLoRA. The Falcon model is a powerful LLM with 40 billion parameters and holds the top position on the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). You can train your own LLM using your own data without sharing it with third-party companies or APIs, in a cost-effective manner.

## Introduction
This repository explores the process of fine-tuning the Falcon 7b LLM model to create a chatbot for specific business purposes, such as an assistance helper or a knowledge base bot. QLoRA library is utilized to achieve efficient fine-tuning while maintaining performance.

## Requirements
To utilize this repository, you will need the following:
- Falcon 7b LLM model
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch framework
- Transformers library (from Hugging Face)
- QLoRA library

## Dataset
The provided guide assumes a dataset consisting of Chatbot customer support Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) from an ecommerce website. However, you can replace this dataset with your own domain-specific data to train the LLM according to your requirements.

## Fine-tuning Process
The necessary steps involved in fine-tuning the Falcon 7b LLM model on the custom dataset are covered. This includes loading the pre-trained model, implementing a LoRA adapter, and conducting the fine-tuning process.

## Evaluation
After the fine-tuning process, the performance of the trained model is evaluated by assessing its responses to various prompts. A comparison between the untrained and trained models is provided to showcase the improvement achieved through fine-tuning.

## Memory-efficient Fine-tuning
To enhance the memory efficiency of the fine-tuning process, the PEFT (Plug-and-Edit Fine-Tuning) library from the Hugging Face ecosystem is leveraged in conjunction with QLoRA. This ensures a more optimized and resource-friendly approach to training your LLM.
